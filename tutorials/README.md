## Lumkani's Deployment Strategy ğŸ“š

As a branch names glossary, at Lumkani we have two immortal branches: <strong>master</strong> and <strong>dev</strong>. Added to that, there are a couple of ephemeral branches: <strong>feature braches</strong> and <strong>release-*</strong>


<ul>

Currently, Lumkani feature process uses feature branches.
